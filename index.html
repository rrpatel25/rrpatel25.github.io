		<h2 id="welcome-head">Welcome, Fellow Draft Junkies</h2>
		<p id="welcome-message">We've been expecting you. The 2017 NBA draft is <em>rapidly</em> approaching us, following an entertaining March Madness conclusion. With the NBA season wrapping up, the tanking at the bottom of the standings is in full swing. The Brooklyn Nets have already solidified their hold at the bottom of the standings, assuring the <em>Celtics</em> (due to the the <a href="http://www.nba.com/nets/news/nets-acquire-nba-champions-kevin-garnett-paul-pierce-and-jason-terry">pick swap</a>) a 25% chance of landing the top pick. The other positions at the bottom of the standings are still up for grabs, with the Suns, Lakers, Magic, and Sixers all vying for a better position...towards the bottom. Before the May 16 draft lottery takes place, I offer my top-3 prospects based on best-player-available (BPA) and potential ceilings.</p>

		<h3 class="prospect-head">1. Markelle Fultz</h3>
		<p class="prospect-info">The combo guard coming out of the University of Washington is number 1 on many draft boards and for good reason. With no glaring weaknesses, here are 3 reasons to draft him first overall:
		<ul class="prospect-list">
			<li>Strong and efficient offensively and defensively</li>
			<li>Has the <strong>IT</strong> factor necessary to turn a franchise's fortunes around</li>
			<li>Good size (6'4) for position, good wingspan, good athleticism</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4 class="prospect-head">2. Josh Jackson</h4>
		<p class="prospect-info">Second on the list is the swingman coming out of the University of Kansas. Hyped as the most exciting prospect coming out of high school, Jackson delivered by showcasing his uber athleticism and ridiculous motor. He also had strong performances during the first few rounds of the Tournament to leave a lasting impression. Here are the 3 reasons to draft him second overall:
		<ul class="prospect-list">
			<li>Strong defensive versatility (can guard 1 through 4)</li>
			<li>Great motor and character (competitive <em>and</em> coachable!)</li>
			<li>He's a deceptively good passer, which is necessary given his lackluster shooting</li>
			<li>BONUS: Great size for position...and did I mention the uber athleticism?</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="prospect-head">3. Jonathan Isaac</h5>
		<p class="prospect-info">This is sure to spur arguments among many draft pundits, as Lonzo Ball out of UCLA is a top-3 prospect for nearly everyone. I am part of the minority who believes his lack of athleticism and defense will catch up with him at the next level. When a franchise is drafting with a top-3 pick, the prospect's <em>long-term</em> potential should be weighed over immediate returns. With that in mind, I believe after the first 2 prospects, Jonathan Isaac out of Florida State University will deliver. Here's why:
		<ul class="prospect-list">
			<li>Elite size for wingman position (6'10)</li>
			<li>Very high defensive potential due to athleticism and length</li>
			<li>Very high offensive potential, due to size+range combination (shot the ball very efficiently from 3-point land)</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h6 id="postgame-head">Post-Game Analysis</h6>
		<p id="postgame-info">Thus these are the controversial top-3 prospects from the class of 2017. As always, the perfect combination of size, athleticism, and character is highly stressed when tasking a prospect with the responsibility to change the direction of a franchise. The NBA Draft selection isn't until June 22, meaning there is still plenty of time to learn more about prospects. In particular, the NBA Draft Combine should help discern significant differences between individual prospect metrics to help with decisions. Until then, let me know who you would select with the number 1 pick down below!</p>

		<p><i><a href="https://theringer.com/the-ringers-2017-nba-draft-lottery-big-board-version-4-0-8425958b85fd">This</a> website is pretty similar to mine and I love the way it is organized. It seemes minimalist in design, where content matters more than presentation. The material is organized in a nice manner with pictures and videos interspersed at right moments. All the while, the user has access to the header options and social media links on the left - touches that make the site look just modern enough.</i></p>

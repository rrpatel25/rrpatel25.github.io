		<h2>Welcome, Fellow Draft Junkies</h2>
		<p>We've been expecting you. The 2017 NBA draft is <em>rapidly</em> approaching us, following an entertaining March Madness conclusion. With the NBA season wrapping up, the tanking at the bottom of the standings is in full swing. The Brooklyn Nets have already solidified their hold at the bottom of the standings, assuring the <em>Celtics</em> (due to the the <a href="http://www.nba.com/nets/news/nets-acquire-nba-champions-kevin-garnett-paul-pierce-and-jason-terry">pick swap</a>) a 25% chance of landing the top pick. The other positions at the bottom of the standings are still up for grabs, with the Suns, Lakers, Magic, and Sixers all vying for a better position...towards the bottom. Before the May 16 draft lottery takes place, I offer my top 3 prospects based on best-player-available (BPA).</p>
